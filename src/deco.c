 * This file illustrates how to use the IJG code as a subroutine library
 * to read or write JPEG image files.  You should look at this code in
 * conjunction with the documentation file libjpeg.txt.
 *
 * This code will not do anything useful as-is, but it may be helpful as a
 * skeleton for constructing routines that call the JPEG library.  
 *
 * We present these routines in the same coding style used in the JPEG code
 * (ANSI function definitions, etc); but you are of course free to code your
 * routines in a different style if you prefer.

/*
 * SOME FINE POINTS:
 *
 * In the above code, we ignored the return value of jpeg_read_scanlines,
 * which is the number of scanlines actually read.  We could get away with
 * this because we asked for only one line at a time and we weren't using
 * a suspending data source.  See libjpeg.txt for more info.
 *
 * We cheated a bit by calling alloc_sarray() after jpeg_start_decompress();
 * we should have done it beforehand to ensure that the space would be
 * counted against the JPEG max_memory setting.  In some systems the above
 * code would risk an out-of-memory error.  However, in general we don't
 * know the output image dimensions before jpeg_start_decompress(), unless we
 * call jpeg_calc_output_dimensions().  See libjpeg.txt for more about this.
 *
 * Scanlines are returned in the same order as they appear in the JPEG file,
 * which is standardly top-to-bottom.  If you must emit data bottom-to-top,
 * you can use one of the virtual arrays provided by the JPEG memory manager
 * to invert the data.  See wrbmp.c for an example.
 *
 * As with compression, some operating modes may require temporary files.
 * On some systems you may need to set up a signal handler to ensure that
 * temporary files are deleted if the program is interrupted.  See libjpeg.txt.
